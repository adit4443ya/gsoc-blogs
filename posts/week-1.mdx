# Week 1: Getting Started with GSOC

Welcome to the first week of my Google Summer of Code journey! This week was all about setting up the project, understanding the codebase, and planning the roadmap ahead.

## Goals
- Set up the development environment.
- Familiarize myself with the projectâ€™s architecture.
- Discuss initial ideas with my mentor.

## Achievements
- Successfully cloned the repository and set up dependencies.
- Explored the codebase and documented key components.
- Had a productive meeting with my mentor to align on project goals.

## Challenges
- Faced some issues with dependency conflicts, resolved by updating Node.js.
- Took time to understand the complex parts of the codebase.

## Next Steps
- Start implementing the first feature.
- Set up CI/CD for automated testing.

Stay tuned for more updates next week!
